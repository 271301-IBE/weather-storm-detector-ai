# Weather Storm Detector - Performance Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to reduce CPU usage and temperature on Raspberry Pi systems.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Monitoring Intervals Optimization
- **Main monitoring cycle**: 10 → 15 minutes (-33% frequency)
- **Local forecast**: 2 → 10 minutes (-80% frequency)
- **Ensemble forecast**: 5 → 30 minutes (-83% frequency)
- **DeepSeek forecast**: 5 → 8 hours (-37% frequency)

### 2. AI Analysis Triggers (More Conservative)
- **Precipitation probability**: 80% → 85% threshold
- **Active precipitation**: 5.0mm → 8.0mm threshold
- **Storm conditions**: Humidity 80% → 85%, Pressure 1010 → 1005 hPa
- **Periodic analysis**: 1 hour → 2 hours interval

### 3. CPU Monitoring & Throttling
- Added real-time CPU usage monitoring
- CPU threshold: 60% (configurable)
- Automatic throttling of non-critical tasks when CPU overloaded
- Smart task skipping when system is under stress

### 4. Code Optimizations
- Removed duplicate `chmi_warning_check()` function
- Added `psutil` for system monitoring
- Improved async operation handling
- Better error handling and resource management

### 5. New Monitoring Tools
- `cpu_monitor.py`: Real-time system monitoring
- `performance_check.sh`: Comprehensive performance analysis
- Enhanced start script with system status display

## Configuration Changes

### New Environment Variables
```bash
# Optimized intervals
MONITORING_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
LOCAL_FORECAST_INTERVAL_MINUTES=10
ENSEMBLE_FORECAST_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30
DEEPSEEK_FORECAST_INTERVAL_HOURS=8

# CPU throttling
MAX_CPU_USAGE_THRESHOLD=60
```

### Updated Default Values
- More conservative AI trigger thresholds
- Longer intervals between intensive operations
- Better resource management

## Expected Performance Improvements

### CPU Usage Reduction
- **Forecast generation**: ~70% less frequent
- **AI analysis**: ~40% less frequent overall
- **Monitoring cycles**: ~33% less frequent

### Temperature Reduction
- Lower sustained CPU usage
- Better thermal management through throttling
- Reduced peak load scenarios

### Memory Optimization
- Better cleanup of cached data
- Reduced memory leaks through improved async handling
- More efficient database operations

## Usage

### Monitor System Performance
```bash
# Show current stats
python3 cpu_monitor.py

# Monitor for 10 minutes
python3 cpu_monitor.py monitor 10

# Check weather processes
python3 cpu_monitor.py processes

# Comprehensive performance check
./performance_check.sh
```

### Start Optimized System
```bash
./start.sh
```

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Monitor CPU usage** during first few hours after optimization
2. **Check temperature** regularly using `cpu_monitor.py`
3. **Review logs** for any missed storm events due to conservative triggers
4. **Adjust thresholds** if needed based on local weather patterns

## Rollback Options

If optimizations cause missed alerts:
1. Reduce AI trigger thresholds in `.env`
2. Decrease monitoring intervals
3. Lower CPU threshold for less aggressive throttling

## Performance Metrics

Expected results on Raspberry Pi:
- CPU usage: 70% → 40-50% average
- Temperature: 5-10°C reduction
- Power consumption: 10-20% reduction
- System responsiveness: Improved

## Notes

- Critical storm alerts are still prioritized
- Lightning detection bypasses CPU throttling
- ČHMÚ warnings maintain full functionality
- Email notifications unchanged
